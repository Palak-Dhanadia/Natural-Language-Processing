Q1:5/5, Q2:3/5, Q3:3/5, Q4:11/15, Q5:22/30. Overall great work! Your method correctly finds examples when these classes include false positives, however you just provide the raw input words, not the entire context. You also fail to offer a report on your examination of the samples and what you learned from them in order to enhance classifier performance. You must explain your observations. Q3 The same problems as in Q2. You should have included the POS tagging in the pre-processing. A number of supplementary features have been introduced, although the feature investigation is not detailed enough. Save performance scores after each step and add them as comments in your code or a report. Overall, fantastic work!
